# Websu
Websu is a MERN stack based web app designed to enhance users hand-eye coordination through a simple target-based game. The purpose of this application is to provide users a fun method of practicing their mechanical aiming skills using either touch or mouse movements. This web-app will feature an aiming activity involving targets that will appear on the users screen, in which the user must attempt to click on these targets to add to their user session score. 

The web-app has multiplayer support, where users can battle against one another in the same lobby, measuring the total correct hits, speed and accuracy of their hits against each other.
